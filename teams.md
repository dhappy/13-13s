There three fleets comprised of the holdings of the thirteen teams with three teams allied red, three blue, and seven purple.

There are almost 68 million slots on Purple teams but only ~2.3k on Red and Blue. Most players will not have direct Red or Blue membership.

I like the idea of teams that one gets access to based on the result of a DNA test. Have a team that is only physical neurodivergents. XY guys and XX gals also a thing. Not for the entirety of their color of alliance, but for one team.

Control of space has to flow through an intermediate purple team before it can return to blue or red. The holder of a space is charged rent by the game in exchange for listing the space. The rent is calculated such that initially and in the early stages, it pays to rent. After some tipping duration it costs.

There is a Purple team which is the zero-cost automated transfer. If you're wanting to transfer to another sexed color (Red or Blue), you can use Peach as the holder between the two possessions. Peach becomes inaccessible to certain classes of rules violators.

Spaces initially pay for themselves through rental fees, but as time passes those amounts drop below the replenishment threshold so it costs the landlord to rent.

All space must be rented at every point in time or a penalty is faced either by the holding team opr a team linked to the unrentability of the space. Each player carries a bank which, depending on a staked amount, has access to different spaces. There is a rentee 

Ultimately, this is about the control of space. Who is allowed to be where when. that's what the real execution of society is about: who controls what space at what point in time.

I want agreements between jurisdictions to exchange people under a movement restriction. The host alliance would review both the original case for incarceration to the incarcerating alliance and the case for expulsion from the host alliances spaces to the incarcerating one.

Teams would need to agree as to which laws to carry between alliances, and which require reoffense to trigger extradition.

We want all land to be communally owned in a market-based system. I believe voluntary coordination is possible.

How is the rental fee for a space determined?

The choice of which organization to use for your event recommender has deep impacts on the functioning of your life, and, could, affect the direction of the economy.

I want to prototype with parties with substances & sex. I want for no one to want for a reasonable physical desire while partying.
